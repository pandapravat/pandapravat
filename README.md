### Hi, I am Pravat!! âœ‹âœ‹

I am a java sofoware engineer with a focus on application architecture. I am a strong supporter of the SOLID design principle. I believe that software code should be readable, easily extensible and scalable. I am also a believer of strong testability of applications. Some technologies I really enjoy working with include java, spring, javafx, jquery etc. I also enjoy creating simple tools ðŸ§° that aid in application developement. Here, in my github page you can find some of such tools. :computer: I am currently working with a healthcare company builing applications that helps caregivers and patients oppurtunity to enrich and improve the quality of hospital stays.
